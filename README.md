#Features

As the user types in the search bar, the search results should update dynamically, similar to Google search suggestions.
Each search result should have a favorite button. Clicking on the favorite button adds the meal to the user's favorite meals list.
Clicking on a particular search result should open a new page with more information about that meal.

`#Meal Detail Page`

Displays detailed information about a selected meal, including its name, photo, instructions, category, and area.
Provides a link to watch a video of the meal preparation on YouTube.

`#My Favorite Meals Page`

Displays a list of all the user's favorite meals.
The favorite meals list is persistent, meaning it retains the same meals even after closing or refreshing the browser.
Each meal in the list has a "Remove from favorites" button. Clicking on this button removes the meal from the favorites list.
